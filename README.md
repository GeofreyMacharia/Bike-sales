# Bike-sales
A fun Excel project where I explored bike sales data, used pivot tables to uncover useful patterns, and wrapped it all up with a neat dashboard to show the key takeaways.

## Overview
This project was all about figuring out what kind of customers are most likely to buy bicycles.
I used Excel to dig into the data, built pivot tables to spot trends, and put together into charts, easy-to-read dashboard.
