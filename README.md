# Bike-sales
A simple Excel project where I explored bike sales data, used pivot tables to get useful data patterns and wrapped it all up with a neat dashboard.

## Overview
This project was all about figuring out what kind of customers are most likely to buy bicycles.
I used Excel to dig into the data, built pivot tables to identify data relationships and trends.
I later visualized the realationships using charts and put together an easy-to-read dashboard to wrap it all up.
